# 🤖 Python Agent Project

Welcome to your Agentuity Python Agent project! This README provides essential information to help you get started with developing, testing, and deploying your AI agents.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **UV**: Version 0.5.25 or higher ([Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent in your project:

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your agent.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your agent to the Agentuity Console in DevMode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agent and deploy it to the cloud, making it accessible via the Agentuity platform.

## 📚 Project Structure

```
├── agents/             # Agent definitions and implementations
├── .venv/              # Virtual environment (created by UV)
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies and metadata
├── server.py           # Server entry point
└── agentuity.yaml      # Agentuity project configuration
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Your project configuration is stored in `agentuity.yaml`. This file defines your agents, development settings, and deployment configuration.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for your project:

```bash
agentuity env set KEY VALUE
```

### Secrets Management

For sensitive information, use secrets:

```bash
agentuity env set --secret KEY VALUE
```
